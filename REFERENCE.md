# AegisOps -- Multimodal Incident Review System

**AegisOps** turns raw incident logs and monitoring screenshots into structured, decision-ready incident reports -- complete with severity classification, root-cause hypotheses, timeline reconstruction, and operator handoff artifacts. A deterministic replay suite tests schema, rubric, and workflow behavior before live model output is trusted; it does not prove every incident conclusion.

## Three-Minute Proof

1. Open the Cloudflare demo or local UI and run one incident scenario.
2. Inspect the replay eval suite before trusting live model output.
3. Run `npm run verify` to cover typecheck, tests, replay evals, surface smoke, and build.
4. Review export and handoff artifacts as operator-facing proof, not just the chat flow.

## System Overview

| Lens | Current answer |
|---|---|
| Users | SOC, IT operations, managed service, and incident-response teams that need clearer handoff after noisy incidents. |
| System scope | Multimodal incident analysis, schema-conformant reports, replay evals, follow-up Q&A, and export paths. |
| Operating boundary | Browser never receives provider keys; demo mode is deterministic and no-key by default. |
| Evaluation path | `npm run verify`, live Cloudflare Pages demo, replay eval suite, and surface smoke script. |

## Evaluation Path

- **Start here:** Open the Cloudflare demo, run one incident scenario, then inspect replay eval coverage.
- **Local demo:** Run `npm install && npm run dev`; the UI runs on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and API on `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.
- **Checks:** Run `npm run verify`; it covers typecheck, tests, replay evals, surface smoke, and build.

## Service Launch Playbook

**Key design principle:** API keys never reach the browser. The React frontend calls `/api/analyze`, `/api/followup`, `/api/tts` -- the Express API reads provider keys server-side and returns validated, schema-conformant JSON.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js >= 20** and npm
- (Optional) A Gemini or OpenAI API key for live analysis
- (Optional) [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for fully offline local analysis

### Run locally

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/KIM3310/AegisOps.git
cd AegisOps
npm install

# 2. Configure (optional -- runs in demo mode without keys)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add GEMINI_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY

# 3. Start both API and UI
npm run dev
# UI:  http://127.0.0.1:3000
# API: http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

If no API key is set, the system runs in **demo mode** -- deterministic output, no external calls, and the full replay eval suite still runs.

### Verify the build

```bash
npm run verify   # typecheck + test + replay evals + surface smoke + build
```

---

## Incident Replay Evals

The replay eval suite validates report quality against fixed scenarios with a structured rubric before the live model path is trusted.

```bash
npm run eval:replays
```

**Suite:** `evals/incidentReplays.ts` | **Scoring:** `server/lib/replayEvals.ts`

### Rubric categories

| Category | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `severity_match` | Severity classification matches the expected level |
| `title_keywords` | Title captures the dominant failure mode |
| `tag_coverage` | Operational tags cover the main systems involved |
| `timeline_coverage` | Timeline retains enough events for reconstruction |
| `root_cause_coverage` | Root causes name the failure mode, not just symptoms |
| `actionability` | Action items are concrete and operator-facing |
| `reasoning_trace` | Reasoning preserves Observations, Hypotheses, Decision Path |
| `confidence_range` | Confidence score stays within the rubric band |

### Current scenarios

| Scenario | Description |
|---|---|
| `llm-latency-spike` | SLO breach, queue saturation, memory pressure, autoscaling recovery |
| `redis-oom-failover` | Redis master OOM, quorum loss, cache miss storm during failover |
| `payments-retry-storm` | 5xx spike + retry fan-out and request queue growth |
| `search-warning-buildup` | Pre-outage warning with latency and queue buildup (no hard outage) |

See `docs/INCIDENT_REPLAY_EVALS.md` for full documentation.
