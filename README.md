# AegisOps — Multimodal Incident Review System

![CI](https://github.com/KIM3310/AegisOps/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

In real incidents, the hard part is rarely missing telemetry. The harder part is turning scattered evidence from logs,
screenshots, and alerts into a report that someone else can review quickly.

**AegisOps** turns that evidence into a structured incident report, postmortem pack, and handoff path that stays easy to inspect.

## Product Family

AegisOps is the multimodal copilot surface in the broader `Aegis` incident-analysis product family.

Companion repo:

- `Aegis-Air`: local-first / air-gapped incident review engine for teams that cannot send telemetry to public APIs

## Demo / Links

- Demo video: https://youtu.be/FOcjPcMheIg
- Cloudflare Pages demo: https://aegisops-ai-incident-doctor.pages.dev
- Google AI Studio demo: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1nInCvCJjSXy0IQGiDeK9gbsjjhhPqtlg?fullscreenApplet=true

## Runtime vs review/demo surfaces

- Primary runtime: the React/Vite UI (`App.tsx`, `components/`, `hooks/`) plus the Express API in `server/` is the main incident workflow.
- Review/demo surfaces: the Cloudflare Pages demo, `docs/`, and `samples/` are there so operators can inspect the incident flow without wiring live providers first.
- Repo map: root `*.tsx` files are the app shell, `scripts/` holds replay/load helpers, and `infra/` carries deployment material.

## Summary Pack At A Glance

- Evaluation API surface: `GET /api/healthz`, `GET /api/meta`, `GET /api/summary-pack`, `GET /api/schema/report`
- Built-in sample pack: `GET /api/resource-pack`
- Bounded public live lane: `POST /api/live-escalation-preview`
- Session history API: `GET /api/live-sessions`, `GET /api/live-sessions/:sessionId`
- Live session surface: `GET /api/live-session-pack`
- Postmortem surface: `GET /api/postmortem-pack`
- System design surface: `GET /api/system-design-pack`
- Incident quality: replay suite with 4 scenarios / 32 rubric checks
- Provider comparison surface: `GET /api/evals/providers`
- Runtime posture: static demo, demo backend, live provider mode, Ollama local
- Export posture: JSON, Markdown, Slack, Jira, plus optional Workspace flows

## Reviewer Fast Path

If someone opens the repo cold, the fastest trustworthy sequence is:

1. `GET /api/healthz` — confirm backend mode, limits, and review links
2. `GET /api/runtime/scorecard` — read runtime posture before any incident claims
3. `GET /api/resource-pack` — inspect built-in incident bundles, annotations, and operator checks
4. `GET /api/system-design-pack` — inspect service topology and failure drill shape
5. `GET /api/live-session-pack` — review the operator handoff surface
6. `GET /api/summary-pack` — compress replay proof, trust boundary, and export posture
7. `GET /api/schema/report` — lock the report contract before downstream use

## Quick Start

- Open `GET /api/live-session-pack` -> `GET /api/postmortem-pack` -> `GET /api/evals/providers` -> `server/`.
- Or start from `GET /api/healthz` -> `GET /api/system-design-pack` -> `GET /api/postmortem-pack` -> `GET /api/live-sessions` -> `GET /api/schema/report`.

## Review Flow

1. `GET /api/healthz` -> confirm deployment mode and backend posture.
2. `GET /api/system-design-pack` -> inspect topology, hot endpoints, and failure drills.
3. `GET /api/live-session-pack` -> inspect realtime modality, operator roles, and live handoff routes.
4. `GET /api/postmortem-pack` -> inspect evidence timeline, replay posture, and handoff contract in one surface.
5. `GET /api/live-sessions` -> verify that live incident loops remain reviewable across multiple requests.
6. `GET /api/resource-pack` -> inspect checked-in incident bundles, annotations, and review checks without live keys.
7. `GET /api/summary-pack` -> inspect replay proof, runtime modes, and trust boundary.
8. `GET /api/evals/providers` -> compare demo/Gemini/Ollama tradeoffs before making runtime-quality or cost claims.
9. `GET /api/schema/report` -> verify incident contract and export boundary.
10. `docs/summary-pack.svg` + `docs/system-design-pack.svg` + `docs/architecture.png` -> read evaluation flow and key hygiene in one glance.

- Discovery notes: [`docs/discovery-guide.md`](docs/discovery-guide.md)

## What It Does

- **Input:** raw text logs + monitoring screenshots
- **Output:** a structured JSON incident report:
  - severity, RCA (root cause analysis) hypotheses, prioritized actions, timeline, prevention recommendations
  - a short **reasoning trace** (Observations / Hypotheses / Decision Path)
- **Included incident replay suite:** rubric-based checks for severity, tags, title quality, actionability, timeline
  coverage, reasoning structure, and confidence bands
- **Follow-up Q&A** grounded on the generated report context
- **Optional:** on-call audio briefing (TTS, text-to-speech)
- **Optional:** export artifacts to Google Workspace (Docs/Slides/Sheets/Calendar, plus Chat webhook)

## Scope

- Built the end-to-end workflow: React/Vite UI + local API proxy (Express) + report schema + follow-up Q&A.
- Implemented JSON extraction/repair so the UI stays stable even when model output is messy.
- Added a fallback demo mode when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is missing.
- Enforced payload guardrails for multimodal inputs (image limits + partial-failure tolerance).
- Kept secrets off the client (server-side key handling; no Vite env injection).
- Exposed replay results through `GET /api/evals/replays` and `npm run eval:replays`.
- Exposed service posture through `GET /api/meta` and report contract guidance through `GET /api/schema/report`.

## Incident Replay Evals

This repo includes a small replay harness for incident analysis quality:

- suite source: `evals/incidentReplays.ts`
- scoring logic: `server/lib/replayEvals.ts`
- validation script: `npm run eval:replays`
- API summary: `GET /api/evals/replays`

The current suite covers 4 scenarios / 32 rubric checks. For the scoring rubric and case design, see
`docs/INCIDENT_REPLAY_EVALS.md`.

## Operator Surfaces

AegisOps exposes explicit review surfaces for operators:

- `GET /api/healthz`
  - current deployment mode, provider, limits, cache posture, and next action
- `GET /api/meta`
  - product workflow, runtime modes, replay summary, operator checklist, and report contract summary
- `GET /api/live-session-pack`
  - realtime modality map, operator roles, reliability posture, and live review routes
- `GET /api/postmortem-pack`
  - evidence-first postmortem pack tying live session traces, runtime telemetry, replay posture, and export-safe handoff together
- `GET /api/resource-pack`
  - checked-in incident bundles, annotations, operator checks, and validation cases for reviewer-safe demos
- `GET /api/live-sessions`
  - persisted incident session history with lane-aware summaries and detailed session timelines
- `GET /api/summary-pack`
  - operator journey, trust boundary, replay evidence, export posture, and documentation links
- `GET /api/schema/report`
  - required incident-report fields, export formats, field guidance, and input guardrails

This is intentional: the repo should be reviewable as a service surface, not just a frontend demo.

## Architecture

The key design goal is **key hygiene**: the Gemini API key must never be shipped to the browser.

![AegisOps Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  UI[React/Vite UI] -->|/api/*| API[Local API Proxy (Express)]
  API -->|Gemini| LLM[Gemini Models]
  UI -->|OAuth token| GWS[Google Workspace APIs]
```

- The frontend calls a local API (`/api/analyze`, `/api/followup`, `/api/tts`).
- The API reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` server-side and calls Gemini.
- Grounding (`googleSearch` tool) is **OFF by default** and must be explicitly enabled.

## Sample Inputs

You can drag & drop sample inputs from `samples/` into the UI:

- `samples/logs/*.txt`
- `samples/screenshots/*.png`

```

For local dev, Vite binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.  
If you need LAN/device testing, set `VITE_DEV_HOST=0.0.0.0` before `npm run dev`.

You can also provide Gemini key from the UI (`API Key` button in top bar).  
That runtime key is kept in backend memory only and resets when the API server restarts.

Google OAuth access tokens are now restored from session only while valid; expired tokens are cleared automatically.

AdSense review helpers are included in `public/ads.txt`, `public/robots.txt`, `public/sitemap.xml`, `public/about.html`, `public/compliance.html`, and `public/_headers`.

### Teachable Machine (Optional)

When `VITE_TM_MODEL_URL` is set, AegisOps can run **local browser-side image classification** before Gemini analysis:

- uploaded screenshots are scored by your Teachable Machine model
- high-confidence labels are appended to log context as `[TM] ...` lines
- failures are non-blocking (analysis continues without TM signals)

## Demo Mode (No Keys Required)

If `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not set, the API switches to **demo mode**:

- analysis returns a deterministic review-only report based on the provided logs
- follow-up Q&A returns a deterministic helper response
- TTS is disabled

This keeps the project runnable without external credentials.

The replay suite also runs in demo mode, so the current score can be reproduced locally.

The Cloudflare Pages deployment also stays usable without a backend. If `/api/*` is unavailable, the frontend falls back to:

- deterministic local incident analysis in the browser
- local replay-suite scoring
- review-only follow-up answers and explicit Workspace export placeholders

## OpenAI Provider

Use this to run incident analysis via the OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini by default).

1. Set `.env`:

```env
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

2. Start app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- If OpenAI fails (network error, quota exceeded, etc.), the server falls back to rule-based demo analysis automatically.
- Image screenshots are forwarded as base64 `image_url` parts with `detail: low`.
- TTS is not supported via OpenAI; the `/api/tts` endpoint returns an empty `audioBase64`.
- Set `AEGIS_AI_PROVIDER` or `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` — both are equivalent. The env var read by the server is `LLM_PROVIDER`.

## Ollama Offline Mode (No Cloud LLM)

Use this when you want offline local inference.

1. Install and run Ollama locally.
2. Pull a model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

3. Set `.env`:

```env
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL_ANALYZE=llama3.1:8b
OLLAMA_MODEL_FOLLOWUP=llama3.1:8b
```

4. Start app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- In `ollama` mode, Gemini API key runtime settings are disabled.
- TTS endpoint is treated as unavailable (`audioBase64` is empty).
- If Ollama is not running/reachable, analyze/follow-up endpoints return `502` with a connection hint.

## Shared Evaluation Framework

AegisOps consumes shared incident taxonomy and evaluation types from the Aegis product family. The single source of truth lives in the sibling `Aegis-Air` repo (Python/Pydantic).

- TypeScript shared types: `server/lib/aegis-shared-types.ts`
- Python source of truth: `Aegis-Air/aegis_engine/shared_eval/schemas.py`
- Sync check: `__tests__/SharedEvalSync.test.ts` validates that TypeScript types match the Python schemas
- Cross-repo sync: `Aegis-Air/tests/test_shared_eval_sync.py` reads the TypeScript types file and validates compatibility

When updating the incident taxonomy or eval rubric:
1. Update the Python schemas in `Aegis-Air/aegis_engine/shared_eval/schemas.py`
2. Run `python -m aegis_engine.shared_eval.export` to regenerate JSON Schema
3. Update `server/lib/aegis-shared-types.ts` to match
4. Run both sync checks to verify compatibility

## Notes / Limitations

- Workspace export features require OAuth scopes; in demo mode those calls are not executed.
- This project is focused on repeatable local review, safety-by-default, and operational UX.

## Glossary (first-time readers)
- SEV1: Severity 1 incident (highest urgency)
- RCA: Root Cause Analysis
- TTS: Text-to-Speech
- OAuth: Open Authorization (browser-based consent flow)
- LLM: Large Language Model

## Local Verification

Fast path:

```bash
npm install
npm run review:smoke
npm run verify
```

Expanded commands:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run eval:replays
npm run review:smoke
npm run build
```

## Repository Hygiene
- Keep runtime artifacts out of commits (`.codex_runs/`, cache folders, temporary venvs).
- Prefer running verification commands above before opening a PR.
